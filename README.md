A fast, effective, and flexible codon optimization tool. Built with Python, the algorithm can codon-optimize your g blocks for multiple species at once, giving preference to one or more espression systems at a time. The algorithm utilizes the most recent codon usage data available to dynamically generate an optimal sequence for you in seconds.

# To Use
1. Head to [the optimization page](https://optipyzer.herokuapp.com/optimize).
