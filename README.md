# Optipyzer
Optipyzer is a multi-species engine that will run codon optimization algorithms on select DNA and Protein sequences - Built in Python, Optipyzer can codon-optimize for multiple species, with select weights given to design expression levels in select species. The appliation is supported with a Web-Based UI developed in React

## To Use
1. Head to [the optimization page](https://optipyzer.herokuapp.com/optimize).
