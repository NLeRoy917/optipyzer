	devBody: "Optipyzer was a multi-species codon optimization engine written in Python by myself (Nathan LeRoy) and Caleigh Roleck at Purdue University as a part of a Bioinformatics course in Spring of 2019. We realized that such an engine would only be widley accessible if it was packaged as a web application. I took on the task of creating a UI for our code, while Caleigh perfected the engine. Without her expertise and incredible hard-work, none of this would be possible. Caleigh is currently piursuing her PhD in Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology at Rice University. I am working as a Research Assistant at the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute in Indianapolis, IN."
